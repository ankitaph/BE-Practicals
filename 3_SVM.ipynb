    "# It is suitable for capturing complex, non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "# The RBF kernel introduces a parameter 'gamma' that controls the shape of the decision boundary.\n",
    "# Smaller values of 'gamma' result in a wider boundary, while larger values result in a narrower boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sigmoid Kernel:\n",
    "# The sigmoid kernel is another non-linear kernel used in SVMs.\n",
    "# It is often used in applications where the data distribution is not well-known or exhibits a sigmoid-like shape.\n",
    "# It introduces parameters 'gamma' and 'coef0' to control the shape of the boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Custom Kernels:\n",
    "# In addition to the standard kernels mentioned above, SVMs can also use custom kernels.\n",
    "# Custom kernels allow you to define a domain-specific kernel function based on your problem's characteristics."
